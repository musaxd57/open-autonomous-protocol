# Open Autonomous Protocol (OAP)
### A Verifiable, Insurance-Aligned, Open-Source Autonomous Driving Stack

> Version: 0.1 (Draft)

---

## 1. Abstract

Autonomous driving systems today are largely closed, opaque, and governed by
company-specific risk assumptions. Society is asked to trust a black box.

*Open Autonomous Protocol (OAP)* proposes a framework where:

- The driving algorithm is *open source*,
- The runtime behavior of the algorithm is *cryptographically verifiable*, and
- The risk model is *aligned with insurance providers* that are willing to
  underwrite crashes caused by the algorithm.

The central question OAP aims to answer:

> “Is this vehicle actually running the licensed, open-source, audited, and
> insurance-backed driving algorithm it claims to run?”

OAP does *not* try to define the “best” driving policy. Instead, it defines
the technical and economic constraints under which any such policy can be
audited, verified, and incentivized.

---

## 2. Motivation

Current autonomous driving ecosystems suffer from several issues:

1. *Opacity of code and training data*  
   - Proprietary models make safety evaluation difficult.  
   - External audits are limited or impossible.

2. *Misaligned incentives*  
   - Companies optimize for growth and cost, not for provable safety.  
   - Risk is often socialized, while upside is privatized.

3. *Regulatory uncertainty*  
   - Regulators lack robust tools to demand verifiable safety guarantees.  
   - Most frameworks rely on ex post accident analysis, not ex ante proofs.

4. *Public trust deficit*  
   - A lack of verifiable guarantees undermines public acceptance.

OAP attempts to address these issues by combining:

- Open-source development practices,
- Verifiable computing and cryptography,
- Explicit integration with insurance markets.

---

## 3. Design Principles

1. *Open Source by Default*  
   - Core driving policies are published under an open license.  
   - Code, tests, and audit reports live in public repositories.

2. *Verifiable by Design*  
   - The protocol is built around the ability to prove that the car
     executed specific logic on specific inputs, within defined constraints.

3. *Insurance-Aligned Risk Sharing*  
   - Algorithms are “licensed” only if an insurer is willing to underwrite
     the risk of their failures.

4. *Modular and Extensible*  
   - OAP defines interfaces and constraints, not a single monolithic stack.

5. *Public Good Orientation*  
   - The protocol is designed as shared infrastructure, not a single-company product.

---

## 4. High-Level Architecture

OAP is organized into three main layers:

1. *Algorithm Layer*  
2. *Verification Layer*  
3. *Incentive Layer*

### 4.1 Algorithm Layer

The Algorithm Layer defines how autonomous driving logic is specified and
published.

- *Open Source Repositories*  
  - Git-based workflows (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).  
  - Mandatory code review, CI, and open issues.

- *Interfaces & APIs*  
  - Standardized APIs for sensing, planning, and control.  
  - Clear separation between platform-specific drivers and core logic.

- *Testing & Validation Suites*  
  - Public simulation scenarios.  
  - Safety-regression test suites.  
  - Benchmarks for edge cases.

The primary artifact of this layer is a *versioned, auditable release* of
the driving stack, e.g. OAP-Drive v1.2.0.

### 4.2 Verification Layer

The Verification Layer ensures that the vehicle is indeed running a
licensed version of an approved algorithm.

Possible components:

- *Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)*  
  - Secure enclaves that attest to the code hash being executed.

- *Verifiable Compute / ZK Proofs*  
  - Zero-knowledge (or related) proofs that a given decision was produced by
    a permitted algorithm on a given input stream.

- *Attestation Protocols*  
  - Periodic or event-based remote attestation to regulators or insurers.  
  - On-chain or off-chain proof aggregation.

The main outcome is a verifiable statement:

> “At time T, vehicle V executed algorithm A (hash H) with attested
> hardware configuration and constraints.”

### 4.3 Incentive Layer

The Incentive Layer defines “who pays when things go wrong” and “who is
rewarded when things go well”.

- *Insurance-Backed Licenses*  
  - An algorithm release is not considered “OAP-compliant” unless an
    insurer has explicitly agreed to underwrite its operational risk.

- *Economic Flows*  
  - Premiums paid by operators/manufacturers.  
  - Payouts to affected parties in case of at-fault incidents.  
  - Reward mechanisms for developers improving safety metrics.

- *On-chain Representation (Optional)*  
  - Policies and commitments may be represented on-chain for transparency.  
  - Not required, but can be beneficial for composability and auditability.

## 5. Threat Model

### 5.1 Adversaries

- *Malicious Operators* – try to run unlicensed or modified code
  while claiming compliance.
- *Malicious Developers* – introduce backdoors or unsafe behavior
  into the codebase.
- *External Attackers* – attempt to compromise hardware or tamper with
  sensor data.
- *Rational but Selfish Actors* – attempt to game metrics or economic
  incentives.

### 5.2 Assumptions

- At least one verification mechanism (TEE, ZK, etc.) is sound and
  difficult to subvert.
- There exists an honest minority of auditors and developers reviewing code.
- Insurance providers are economically motivated to avoid excessive risk.

### 5.3 Goals

OAP seeks to make it:

- *Hard to cheat* without being detected,
- *Expensive to cheat* when compared to honest operation,
- *Economically attractive* to participate honestly.

## 6. Governance

This draft does not fully specify governance, but outlines options:

1. *Foundation Model*  
   - A non-profit foundation coordinates standards, reference implementations,
     and releases.

2. *Multi-Stakeholder Council*  
   - Representatives from:
     - Open-source developers
     - Vehicle manufacturers
     - Insurers
     - Regulators
     - Civil society

3. *On-chain Governance (Optional)*  
   - Some decisions (e.g., parameter updates, grant distributions) may be
     governed via on-chain voting by recognized stakeholders.

Key questions:

- Who approves new algorithm releases as “OAP-compliant”?
- Who can revoke a license in case of discovered vulnerabilities?
- How are disputes between stakeholders resolved?

## 7. Implementation Roadmap (Draft)

1. *Phase 0 – Manifesto & Community Formation (0–3 months)*  
   - Publish this whitepaper as v0.1.  
   - Attract early contributors across ML, cryptography, insurance, and policy.

2. *Phase 1 – Simulation Prototype (3–12 months)*  
   - Implement a “verifiable driving loop” in a simulation environment.  
   - Demonstrate that decisions are provably generated by a given algorithm.

3. *Phase 2 – Hardware Integration (12–24 months)*  
   - Integrate with specific hardware platforms / TEEs.  
   - Run small-scale closed-track tests.

4. *Phase 3 – Insurance & Regulatory Pilots (24–36+ months)*  
   - Collaborate with one or more insurers for pilot policies.  
   - Explore regulatory sandboxes in forward-looking jurisdictions.

## 8. Risks and Open Questions

- *Technical Complexity* – Verifiable compute at real-time speeds is hard.  
- *Regulatory Capture* – Large firms may attempt to dominate standards.  
- *Over-Reliance on Specific Crypto Primitives* – Long-term cryptographic
  assumptions may fail.  
- *Liability Fragmentation* – Too many parties may blur responsibility.

Open research questions include:

- Efficient proof systems tailored for driving workloads.  
- Practical schemes for partial logging that preserve privacy.  
- Balanced governance structures that avoid capture.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Open Autonomous Protocol is an attempt to reframe autonomous driving as:

- A *public good*,
- With *open, verifiable logic*, and
- *Explicit economic alignment* between those who build, deploy, insure,
  and are affected by these systems.

This document is a starting point, not a finished design. Constructive
criticism, alternative architectures, and practical field experience
are explicitly invited.
